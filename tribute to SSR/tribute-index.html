            <h3>Personal Life</h3>
            <p> <span>Rajput</span>'s personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention. In <span> 2011 </span>, Rajput had publicly proposed to his Pavitra Rishta co-star <span> Ankita Lokhande </span> during a national broadcast of the dance competition show Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa; both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants. The couple were dating after their first meeting on the sets of Pavitra Rishta, where they were incidentally cast in the role of husband and wife to each other. Since <span>2012</span> , they began living as cohabiting partners. In the following period, reports of an imminent marriage between the two occasionally kept cropping up in the media. In an interview, Rajput had stated that marriages and cohabitation were no different from each other and that the country was full of hypocrites who made it seem like the former was sacred and the latter was a crime. <br></p>
             <p> After Rajput's death, Chakraborty confirmed that she was his girlfriend and that he had refused medication, relying instead on yoga and meditation for relief. According to Rajput's father, the actor planned to marry in 2021 but did not reveal his intended bride; Ankita Lokhande was the only girlfriend of Rajput that his father had known about. </p>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>On <span> 14 June 2020</span>, Rajput, aged 34, was found <span> dead</span>, hanging from the ceiling fan in his home in Bandra, Mumbai. He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and was suffering from <span> bipolar disorder</span>. The Mumbai Police commenced an investigation, stating that the death was being treated as a <span>suicide</span>. The postmortem report stated that the cause of death was "asphyxia due to hanging," and called it a "<span>clear case of suicide</span>." The autopsy doctors placed time of death at 10 to 12 hours before postmortem examination on 14 June at 11:30 p.m.—meaning between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. (Indian Standard Time). No foul play was found. The viscera report likewise ruled out foul play. On 25 July, Rajput's family lodged a first information report with police in Patna, where his father lives, accusing Rhea Chakraborty and five others of abetment of suicide.</p>
